# my-express-server
A small project to checkout how NodeJS and Express work
- After downloading/cloning the project, run `npm init` in the project directory (directory where the project was downloaded)
- Run `npm i express` to install express.
- (Optional) run `npm i nodemon` to install nodemon (node monitor), this allows automation of server updates upon changes in project files.
- If the previous step was followed, run `npx nodemon server.js` to run the server from your favourite terminal.
